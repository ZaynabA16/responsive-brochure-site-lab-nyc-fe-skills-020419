        <h3>What I've learned in Intro to Front End Development</h3>
        <p>I've learned quite a bit in this class. We've covered HTML tags, attributes, and values. We've covered CSS fundamentals, selectors and more. We went through Flex-box and a new concept aptly named grid. And of course, we covered much, much more.</p>
      </div>
      <section class= "learned">
        <p>To go into some more specifics, we learned Media queries and Command terminal prompts, surge applications and iframes. We even learned about references we can use later on, things like Cheeseburger ipsum, hipster ipsum, Stumble Upon, and Bada55.io. Well, there was more but I've decided to keep it short. Just a snapshot into what we've gone over and what I've learned. </p>

        <p> Well, I did want to mention what we'll be learning in the weeks to come. It seems like we'll cover javascript and the way it ties into CSS and HTML.</p>
        <h4>So, to summarize. We've covered:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Flex-box</li>
          <li>Grid</li>
          <li>iframes</li>
          <li>ipsums</li>
          <li>Terminal Commands</li>
          <li>Servers and Clients</li>
          <li>HTML tags and attributes</li>
          <li>CSS Selectors and Rules</li>
          <li>& Media Queries</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>And we'll cover javascript in the weeks to come!</h4>

      <h3>Here, you'll see a cheeseburger and a cheeseburger ipsum aptly dedicated to the Cheeseburger.</h4>
       <article>Think of cheeseburgers like a Tinder match. They might not all be your soulmate but you’ve gotta find out to be sure. It can get a little messy and that’s just part of the fun.
      </article><article>
        Some are cheesy, others can be a little dry, and the rare few are a disaster. There are so many cheeseburgers out there it can be hard to commit to just one favourite. That being said, when you know, you just know.

        Everyone has their perfect match. Sometimes it’s just around the corner, other times you have to travel the world in search of it. Wherever your perfect cheeseburger is, it’s out there.</article>
        <article>Epic cheeseburgers come in all kinds of manifestations, but we want them in and around our mouth no matter what. Slide those smashed patties with the gently caramelized meat fat between a toasted brioche bun and pass it over. You fall in love with the cheeseburger itself but the journey ain’t half bad either.

    <h3>Some things I'd like to learn after Front End Dev</h3>
    <section>
      I thought I might mention what I'd like to learn after this class. I'd probably like to cover back end development so I can do full stack at some point. I may want to take some Graphic design classes so anything I do make is made to look well. Other than that, and this doesn't have much to do with web development but I'd probably like to learn a bit about cyber-security. It just seems prudent.
